# Testing functionality of Ray in Laravel

https://myray.app/


#### Installation
- `composer install`
- `cp .env.example .env` and set up .env
- `php artisan key:generate`
- `php artisan migrate --seed` or `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --env=testing`


#### Usage

Most ray methods you can test via files located in `tests/Feature/Ray` directory.

It was the fastest way I could show you how ray works by run test by test.

That is why I located there - for increasing tempo of the presentation.


#### Presentation file

You can find my presentation in main directory of this repository - `RAFAL_MIGDA_RAY.pdf` (only polish version available for now).
